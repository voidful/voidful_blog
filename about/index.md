### Skill
Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, Crawler, Web Framework, Data Mining   
Android develop   
Front-end, Adobe illustrator Design, little Backend    

### Project   
####   Medical Record Analytic
Extract knowledge form medical record which have different expressions due to doctor's expression.   
   
#### Zero Short End to End Cantonese Speech Recognition   
Lack of cantonese corpus is most of problem.Now trying to solve it in transfer learning ways.    
 
#### Chinese Machine Reading Comprehension
SQUAD base machine Machine Reading Comprehension with different approach, such as BIDAF, QANet, Bert Fine tuning, Bert with QANet.
Now working on multi document answering.Duling with efficiency and accuracy is challenge.   

#### Bert For Sentence Generate 
[Coalb Trial](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1AMcUHMzCny4RrPppM2_VnzN8p59w87YT)    
Trial of bert fineturing on sentence generating in different approach : generate one by one, generate one time ,generate from LSTM.   

#### Cipher 
[Cipher Github](https://voidful.github.io/Cipher/)     
Open source Android app,it can let you hash your password before typing.   

#### Python NLP Preprocessing Toolkit
[nlp2 Github](https://github.com/voidful/nlp2)     
Python library that help to do text mining and preprocessing, with unit test and detail document

#### OOV Word Extraction   
[Phraseg Github](https://github.com/voidful/Phraseg)     
A different approach that can extract new phrase in short text.It use conditional probability different to PMI and Entropy. Compare to others, it have less limit on size of input corpus and less computation.    

#### Active Learning For Question Answering  
[ActiveBag Github](https://github.com/voidful/ActiveBag)      
Using Fasttext train multi-classifier, select retrain sample form voting, entropy and clustering.So that we can use less labeling effort to get a high accuracy.    

#### Knowledge Extraction with WiKi Dump   
Mining from Wiki Dump data, getting plain text, synonym from redirect, translation from language link and relationship from category.   

#### Web Crawler For Well-know Hong Kong & Taiwan Website
Collect corpus for nlp task, base on scrapy, crawling all text in 19 well-know website :
